This is a command line version of the game Othello. To play, build with the
make command, and then simply enter "play".

Rules:
Othello is a strategy game similar to checkers. The goal is to have as many
of your color pieces on the board at the end of the game.

1. Every valid play must "flank" at least 1 piece of the opposing color

2. When pieces are flanked, it means that a contiguous block of a certain color
   is enclosed at either end of a certain direction. When this happens, all
   enclosed pieces will flip to the flanking color.

3. Play continues until the board is filled or all pieces on the board are the
   same color
